      <h1>What is the JAKL?</h1>
	  
	  <h2>  <a href="Jakl Table.html" > Table</a>  <a href="About.html" >Contact Us</a></h2>
	  
	  
    
      <p>The JAKL is a new type of fire arm made by <em>PSA</em> Palmeto State Armory that uses a monolithic upper.<br>
	  This means that all of the operating system is contained inside the uper reciver.<br>
	  With type of system you dont need an external buffer or buffer tube and this allows you to shorten the length of the gun.<br>
	  This also allows you to run the gun with a folding stock.<br>
	  You can have the stock folded and the gun will still operate because of its monolithic upper and long stroke piston operating system.<br>
	  </p>

      <p>The upper can combined with any standered mil-spec AR-15 Lower Reciver.<br>
	  All you need to do is add on the Jakl adapters to make it work with the upper.<br>
	  All this piece does is keep the operating system contained inside the upper while the gun is cycling.<br>
	  This is why it dosent matter if you have your stock folded or locked in place while you are running the gun.<br> </p>

	  This is a picture of the PSA Stock adapter.<br>
	  This piece can be put on any standered lower reciver in minutes.<br>
	  With this the manule of arms is very similar to a standared Ar-15.
	  The only other main difference from a standered Ar-15 is the charging handle.<br>
	  The charging handle on the Jakl can be placed on either side of the weapon and is located further towards the muzzle.</p>
